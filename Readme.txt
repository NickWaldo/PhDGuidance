This github site is a respository set up by graduate students for graduate students
in Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Washington.

Please use this material to speed you way to graduation and contribute material
you believe will help the next student as a way of passing it forward.

It takes a team to complete a Ph.D.; lets work together to reach that goal.
